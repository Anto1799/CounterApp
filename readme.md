Features
The Counter App includes several modern web development features that make it both functional and educational:
The application provides an elegant user interface with gradient backgrounds and glass-morphism effects. Users can interact with the counter through multiple methods:

Visual interface with animated buttons for increment, decrement, and reset
Keyboard shortcuts for quick access (arrow keys, +/-, R for reset)
Operation history displaying the last 5 actions
Smooth animations providing visual feedback for each action
Fully responsive design that works on all device sizes
Dark theme with neon accents for modern aesthetics

Getting Started
Prerequisites
You only need a modern web browser to run this application. For development, we recommend:

Visual Studio Code or any modern code editor
Live Server extension for local development
Chrome DevTools for debugging

Installation

Clone the repository:
bashCopygit clone [repository-url]
cd counterapp

Launch the application:

Using Live Server in VS Code:

Right-click on index.html
Select "Open with Live Server"


Or simply open index.html in your browser:

Double-click the file in your file explorer
Drag the file into your browser window





Usage Guide
Mouse Controls
The interface provides three main buttons:

"+" button: Increases the counter by one
"-" button: Decreases the counter by one
"Reset" button: Returns the counter to zero

Keyboard Controls
For faster interaction, you can use keyboard shortcuts:

Press ↑ or + to increment
Press ↓ or - to decrement
Press R to reset the counter

History Feature
The application maintains a history of your last 5 operations, displaying them with color coding:

Green for increments
Red for decrements
Cyan for reset operations

Technical Details
HTML Structure
The application uses dynamic HTML generation through JavaScript, demonstrating modern DOM manipulation techniques. This approach provides better maintainability and programmatic control over the user interface.
CSS Architecture
The style.css file in the assets/css directory implements:

Modern flexbox layouts for responsive design
CSS animations for smooth visual feedback
Glass-morphism effects using backdrop-filter
Media queries for device-specific styling
CSS custom properties for consistent theming

JavaScript Implementation
The javascript.js file in assets/js contains:

State management for the counter value
Event listeners for both mouse and keyboard interactions
Dynamic DOM updates
History management with visual feedback
Animation control functions


Style Customization
To modify the appearance:

Navigate to assets/css/style.css
Update the color schemes in the CSS variables
Modify the animation parameters
Adjust the responsive breakpoints

JavaScript Enhancement
To extend the functionality:

Open assets/js/javascript.js
Add new event listeners for additional features
Implement new animation effects
Extend the history management system
